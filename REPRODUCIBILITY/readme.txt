READ ME - REPRODUCIBILITY PACKAGE

This folder contains the data and the link needed to reproduce the results in:
"Leader-Follower Sizing in Heterogeneous UAV Swarms for SAR: Latency–Coverage Trade-Offs via Discrete-Event Simulation"

CONTENTS
poi_1000_all_seeds.xlsx - Raw measurements for workload P=1000 across all seeds.
poi_2500_all_seeds.xlsx - Raw measurements for workload P=2500.
poi_4000_all_seeds.xlsx - Raw measurements for workload P=4000.
final_summary.xlsx - Aggregated results and computed means per configuration.

CODE REPOSITORY
The source code, simulation scripts, and figure-generation tools are hosted in the anonymized repository:
